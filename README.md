# React Tetris
React Tetris is a classic Tetris game developed using ReactJS. The game is fully functional and provides a fun gaming experience for Tetris fans.
## Getting Started
To get started with React Tetris, you can clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Touisse/Tetris_Game.git
```

Then, navigate to the root folder of the project and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd react-tetris
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server and launch the game:
```bash
npm start
```

## Gameplay
React Tetris follows the same gameplay mechanics as the original Tetris game. The goal is to stack the falling tetrominoes (shapes made up of four squares) in such a way that they create a complete row of blocks without any gaps. Once a row is complete, it disappears, and the player earns points.

The game gets progressively harder as the player advances to higher levels, with the tetrominoes falling faster and faster. The game is over when the blocks stack up to the top of the game board.

## Controls
React Tetris can be played using the following keyboard controls:

 - Left arrow - Move the tetromino left <br>
 - Right arrow - Move the tetromino right<br>
 - Down arrow - Move the tetromino down faster<br>
 - Up arrow - Rotate the tetromino<br>
 - Spacebar - Drop the tetromino all the way to the bottom<br>

## Future Improvements
Some potential improvements for React Tetris include:

 - Adding sound effects and music
 - Adding high scores and leaderboards
 - Improving the UI and design
## Conclusion
React Tetris is a fun and challenging game that provides a great gaming experience for fans of the classic Tetris game. It was developed using ReactJS and other web technologies and is fully functional and ready to play.
